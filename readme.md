# Template Inspector

This Chrome Extension creates a context menu item called "Inspect Template".  Clicking this will open your editor to
 the file which generated the template.

This is enabled through special comments which are generated by the server.  Have your server wrap ever render
with the follwing syntax:

```html
<!--begin partial /full/path/to/your/file.rb-->
<p>Template contents here</p>
<!--end partial-->
```

Note that HTML comments can not be nested.  Be sure that you have no multiline HTML comments surrounding render calls.
